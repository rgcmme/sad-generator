After three years as a software engineer, since he graduated in Computer Science (2003) he has been working at UPM in the Ontology Engineering Group in a wide range of European and Spanish research projects as well as in different collaborations with the industry. His research focuses on ontological engineering and on ontology-based data and application integration. In 2008 he obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the UPM with his thesis titled “Benchmarking Semantic Web technology”, which obtained the Ph.D. Extraordinary Award at UPM. Since 2015 he is a member of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP) and since 2012 he is Europe Liaison of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE). He has authored more than 120 publications and regularly participates in the program committees of the conferences and workshops that are most relevant in his field and in standardization bodies such as W3C, ETSI or AENOR (he is a member of the W3C Advisory Committee). He has worked on the topic of semantic interoperability for IoT and on the standardisation of IoT ontologies in the W3C with the SSN ontology and in ETSI with the SAREF ontology. Besides, he has collaborated in the organization of 20 conferences and 9 workshops (taking different roles in them). ",Associate Professor,https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulgarciacastro/
